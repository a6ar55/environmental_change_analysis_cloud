# Environmental Change Analysis Platform

A comprehensive platform for environmental monitoring combining deforestation detection and climate analysis using AI and Google Cloud.

## Features

### üå≤ Deforestation Detection
- Upload satellite/aerial images for analysis
- AI-powered semantic segmentation using Random Forest
- Real-time forest coverage percentage calculation
- Visual overlay showing forest vs deforested areas
- Powered by Google Cloud Vertex AI

### üå°Ô∏è Climate Analysis Dashboard
- Interactive temperature trends visualization
- Seasonal climate patterns analysis
- Future temperature predictions (1-10 years)
- Country-specific climate data exploration
- Real-time climate status monitoring

## Data Management

### Large Files Handling
This project uses large datasets and trained models that are **NOT stored in Git** for performance reasons:

**Excluded from Git (stored locally/cloud only):**
- `climate_data/*.csv` (508MB+ of historical temperature data)
- `climate_models.pkl` (217MB trained ML models)
- `*.pkl` files (processed datasets and models)

**Why these files are large:**
- **Climate data**: 270+ years of global temperature records (1743-2013)
- **City data**: Temperature records for thousands of cities worldwide
- **ML models**: Trained Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Linear Regression models

**Data Sources:**
- Climate data: Berkeley Earth temperature dataset via Kaggle API
- Models: Trained on Google Cloud Vertex AI
- Storage: Google Cloud Storage for production data

**To get the data:**
1. Run the climate data processor: `python climate_data_processor.py`
2. Train models: `python climate_vertex_trainer.py`
3. Data will be downloaded/generated automatically
